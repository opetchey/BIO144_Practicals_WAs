<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>All homework is for your own practice and learning. It will not be
marked or graded.</p>
<div id="section-homework-common-to-all-weeks" class="section level3">
<h3>Homework common to all weeks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Review the material from the lecture(s) this week. Make sure you
understand the concepts and ideas presented. Ensure you can follow any
mathematical or statistical explanations. Ensure you can do the R that
is needed for the week’s learning objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>When you find things you don’t understand or have trouble doing
(e.g., in R), make a note of these. You can then ask a teaching
assistant (TA) for help during the practical session, and you can ask on
the Discussion Forum on OLAT. You can also ask questions during the
lectures.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="section-reading" class="section level3">
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>Here is some reading covering various aspects of one-way ANOVA. The
reading covers the core concepts and practices of ANOVA, as well as
talking about other important topics, such as degrees of freedom and
hypothesis testing. You might think there is some overlap with what
you’ve already heard and read, and in some cases you’d be right.
Hopefully you can decide if what you’re reading you already know, if its
giving you a new perspective on something you already know, or its it
really quite new to you. So, here’s the reading for this week, with some
notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-way analysis of variance, example with effects of parasites on
Daphnia growth rate – Section 5.6 from Getting Started with R,
Beckerman, Childs &amp; Petchey.</li>
<li>For a different perspective and a bit more statistical detail, see
one-way analysis of variance, example of plant height and pollination,
Chapter 2 of The New Statistics with R, Hector. (Section 2.4 is not so
important, and there are better methods for changing between the two
mentioned data formats).</li>
<li>Post-hoc tests, multiple comparisons are covered in Box 6.3 and 6.4
of the New Statistics with R. Some interesting perspective in
there.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-anova-and-the-f-test" class="section level3">
<h3>ANOVA and the F-test</h3>
<p>Its worth being really clear about the null and alternate hypothesis
tested in ANOVA by the F-test. Therefore, this is a reminder of what’s
already in the course book.</p>
<p>Imagine we’re going one-way ANOVA, and our treatment and therefore
explanatory variable has four categories (levels). Lets call them A, B,
C, and D.</p>
<p>It is useful and helpful to think of the null hypothesis of the
F-test in ANOVA as “the means of the groups are all the same”, or at
least “the means of the groups are not significantly different”. This
means that the alternate hypothesis is that they are not all the same!
That’s it.</p>
<p>So, if we get a large F value, and consequently a low p-value, we can
reject the null hypothesis, and say that not all the mean are the same.
That leaves a lot of possibilities though. It could be that A is
different from B, C, &amp; D, which are all the same. Or A and B are the
same, and C and D are the same, and A is less than C. And so on and so
on. The F-test doesn’t say anything about which means are different from
which.</p>
<p>So when we look at the ANOVA table in R (or anywhere) this is what
we’re testing.</p>
<p>If we look at the summary table, we get some of the pairwise
comparisons among the categories, but not all of them. We can get them
all if we want (this is called multiple post-hoc comparison), but its a
bit of a minefield. Better to specify specific questions and the
corresponding hypothesis to be tested at the start of a study than to
look at every possible pairwise comparison, report the significant ones,
and attempt to explain that pattern.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia “This [the F-test] is an example of an”omnibus” test,
meaning that a single test is performed to detect any of several
possible differences.”</p>
<p>(By the way, please be careful with Wikipedia, and more generally the
internet. It feels a bit patronising to write this, but not everything
there is correct/true.)</p>
<p>Another perspective on the same… Actually, the F-value is a ratio of
two variances… it is the explained variance / unexplained variance. The
explained variance is the part of the total that is “explained” when one
accounts for the means of the groups / categories. The unexplained is
the part of the total that then remains unexplained. There are no
differences between specific groups / categories in this calculation, so
the F-test can’t tell us (and was not designed to) tell us anything
about differences between particular categories.</p>

<div id="section-practical" class="section level2">
<h2>Practical</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Prepare a script, load the data, and make some basic checks on the
dataset.</li>
<li>Visualise blood pressure change by treatment group
(e.g. boxplots).</li>
<li>Fit a one-way ANOVA model to test for differences between
treatments.</li>
<li>Check the assumptions of ANOVA using residual diagnostics.</li>
<li>Interpret the ANOVA table.</li>
<li>Make a visualisation of the data, good for publication.</li>
<li>Write a short reporting sentence describing your findings.</li>
<li>(Optionally) Perform post-hoc comparisons to identify which
treatments differ.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will analyse simulated data from a fictitious small clinical
study investigating the effect of different treatments on systolic blood
pressure (SBP). High systolic blood pressure is a major risk factor for
cardiovascular disease. A new drug (Drug A) is being tested at two
different dose levels, and its performance is compared with both a
placebo and standard care. Participants were randomly assigned to one of
four treatment groups and had their systolic blood pressure
measured:</p>
<ul>
<li>at baseline (before treatment), and</li>
<li>after 8 weeks of treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary question of interest is whether the average change in
systolic blood pressure differs between treatment groups.</p>
<p>This is a classic one-way ANOVA question, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the response variable is the change in systolic blood pressure,
and</li>
<li>the explanatory variable is treatment group.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will work with the dataset <code>systbp_drug_effect.csv</code>,
which contains one row per participant.</p>
<p>The variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>id: A unique identifier for each participant.</li>
<li>treatment: The treatment group the participant was assigned to:
Placebo, DrugA_Low, DrugA_High, StandardCare</li>
<li>sex: Biological sex of the participant (F or M).</li>
<li>age_years: Age of the participant in years.</li>
<li>baseline_sbp: Baseline systolic blood pressure (mmHg), measured
before treatment.</li>
<li>followup_sbp: Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) measured after 8 weeks
of treatment.</li>
<li>sbp_change</li>
</ul>
<p>Change in systolic blood pressure, calculated as:</p>
<p> - </p>
<p>Negative values indicate a reduction in blood pressure.</p>
<p>Some participants have missing follow-up measurements. You will need
to decide how to handle these when performing your analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Important note</strong> This dataset is synthetic (made up
for teaching purposes), but it is designed to resemble real biomedical
data. As in real studies, the data are not perfect: there is variability
within groups, some missing values, and the effects are not identical
for all individuals. Your task is not just to “run the analysis”, but to
think critically about what the results do and do not tell you.</p>
<div id="section-get-organised-and-prepared" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Get organised and prepared</h3>
<p>Get the dataset from the usual place. It is named
“systbp_drug_effect.csv”.</p>
<p>Make a new script, write a comment or comments in the first lines to
say what the script is for, and load the tidyverse. Then read in the
dataset and take a look at it.</p>

<p>Actually, in that question we assumed that number of rows equals
number of participants. Is that true? Check the number of unique
participant IDs to be sure. There are 100 unique IDs, so yes, each row
corresponds to a different participant. But this does not have to be so
in all datasets! Be careful. Don’t assume!</p>

</div>
<p>Safest now is to create a version of the dataset without the missing
values for the response variable. Please do this now.</p>
<p>Before we move on, let’t think about <strong>degrees of
freedom</strong>.</p>
<p>In one-way ANOVA, there are two types of degrees of freedom to
consider. One is associated with the treatment groups, and the other
with the residuals (within groups). So when we eventually report our
ANOVA results, we will need to know both. We will then be able to write
something like: “Blood pressure was reduced by … (one-way ANOVA
F(???1???, ???2???) = 5.67, p &lt; 0.01).” Where ???1??? is the degrees
of freedom associated with the treatment groups, and ???2??? is the
degrees of freedom associated with the residuals.</p>
<p>Before we get to those degrees of freedom, we need to know two
things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many treatment groups are there?</li>
<li>How many total observations (non-missing values) are there? We know
this already… 98.</li>
</ul>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="quiz-anova-n-groups" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="quiz-anova-n-groups-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="quiz-anova-n-groups-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="quiz-anova-n-groups-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>The degrees of freedom associated with the treatment groups is simply
the number of groups minus one. So here, with 4 treatment groups, the
degrees of freedom for the treatment groups is 4 - 1 = 3.</p>
<p>There are two ways to calculate the degrees of freedom associated
with the residuals (error degrees of freedom). The first is to take the
total number of observations and subtract the number of groups (= number
of beta coefficients estimated). The second corresponds better to the
ANOVA table calculation, and is to take the total number of observations
minus one, and then subtract the treatment degrees of freedom, where the
treatment degrees of freedom is the number of groups minus one.</p>

<p>In the graph, you likely see that the DrugA high treatment is first,

alphabetically by default. It would be better to have the treatments
ordered in a more logical way. Please do this now. Hint:</p>

<h3>8. Perform a post-hoc comparisons to identify which treatments

pairwise comparisons. There are many methods for doing this. Use Tukey’s

<div id="section-critique" class="section level3">
<h3>Critique</h3>
<p>One issue with our analysis is that we did not consider any
covariates that might influence blood pressure change, such as age and
sex. We could do that using two-way ANOVA or ANCOVA. These analyses are
beyond the scope of this exercise, but you will soon see them!</p>
<p>Another issue is we don’t quite know the exact design of the study.
Specifically, we don’t know if the Placebo treatment also included
standard care, or if it was just a placebo pill with no other treatment.
This matters because it affects how we interpret the results. If Placebo
and the drug treatments included standard care, then the comparison
between Placebo and StandardCare tells us about the effect relative to
standard care. If Placebo and drug treatments did not include standard
care (probably the case give the pattern in the data), then the
comparisons tells us about the effects relative to no standard care. So,
for example, placebo (with no standard care) is worse than standard care
without placebo. This ambiguity highlights the importance of clearly
understanding the study design when interpreting statistical results.
What design do you think would be best here?</p>
<p>Personally, I would like to see control, in which participants
receive standard care only, without any placebo or drug. This would
allow us to isolate the effect of the drug itself more clearly. And then
placebo could be standard care plus a placebo pill. And the drug
treatments would be standard care plus the drug at different doses. This
design would help us understand the added benefit of the drug over
standard care. Maybe it would be even better to have a group without any
treatment at all, but that might be unethical if standard care is known
to be beneficial.</p>
<p>Another point we might want to address is the potential effect of the
data points with large residuals. These points could be outliers or
influential points that unduly affect the model fit and the ANOVA
results. It would be prudent to investigate these points further,
perhaps by examining their characteristics. If you have time, make a new
version of the analysis excluding these points, and see if the results
change substantially. If they do, we need to be cautious in interpreting
the findings, as they may be driven by a few extreme observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-some-things-to-note" class="section level3">
<h3>Some things to note</h3>
<p>We did not look at the summary table of the model using the
<code>summary()</code> function. This is because for one-way ANOVA, the
key results are in the ANOVA table produced by the <code>anova()</code>
function. The summary table provides coefficient estimates for each
treatment group compared to a reference group, but it does not directly
test the overall hypothesis of equal means across all groups. Therefore,
for our purposes here, the ANOVA table is more informative.</p>
<p>We didn’t calculate the r-squared value for the model either. While
r-squared can provide some information about the proportion of variance
explained by the treatment groups, it is not the primary focus in
one-way ANOVA. The main goal is to test whether there are significant
differences between group means, which is accomplished through the
F-test in the ANOVA table. R-squared is more commonly used in regression
contexts where the emphasis is on prediction rather than hypothesis
testing.</p>
