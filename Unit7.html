<div id="section-homework-common-to-all-weeks" class="section level3">
<h3>Homework common to all weeks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Review the material from the lecture(s) this week. Make sure you
understand the concepts and ideas presented. Ensure you can follow any
mathematical or statistical explanations. Ensure you can do the R that
is needed for the week’s learning objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>When you find things you don’t understand or have trouble doing
(e.g., in R), make a note of these. You can then ask a teaching
assistant (TA) for help during the practical session, and you can ask on
the Discussion Forum on OLAT. You can also ask questions during the
lectures.</p></li>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>Remember, all this is optional, for your own learning and practice.
You do not have to do any of this reading if you don’t want to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-way analysis of variance, example of cow growth and their diets
– Section 6.1 &amp; 6.2 from Getting Started with R, Beckerman, Childs

<li>One-way and two-way analysis of variance, example with plant
biomass, fertilizer, and light, Chapter 6 of The New Statistics with R,
Hector. (You’ll see some use of the qplot function here; some people
think this is a quick way of making ggplots. Prof. Petchey
doesn’t.)</li>
<li>Read about ANCOVA in section 6.3 of Getting Started with R, by
Beckerman, Childs, and Petchey.</li>
<li>For an alternate perspective on ANCOVA, read chapter 7 of The New
Statistics with R. This chapter includes Box 7.3 about something called
orthogonality… which is a quite important difference between data coming
from well designed experiments and data coming from elsewhere.</li>

<h3>Videos about ANCOVA</h3>
<p>In this series of videos, Prof. Petchey explains ANCOVA, and shows
how to do it in R. He does this by showing first regression, then ANOVA,
then ANCOVA, all with one dataset. The videos were made a while back, so
some details of the content does not fit perfectly with the current
content and structure of the course. But the statistics don’t
change!</p>
<p>The first video introduces the case study and dataset, and then
performs simple linear regression.</p>

<h3>0. The biological question</h3>
<p>The seashore is a lovely place, though in Zurich we’re not best
placed to often enjoy one. Fortunately we have the lake. But I digress.
One of the great things about some seashores is the animal and plants
that live there, especially in the intertidal, the area between low and
high tide where environmental conditions vary enormously over short
distances and short timescales. In the intertidal, interactions among
organisms can be quite important. The study you’re going to work on in
this practical exercise is about herbivory by organisms such as limpets,
and how this might vary across the intertidal, from low in the
intertidal to higher up. The example comes from the book <em>The
Analysis of Biological Data</em> by Whitlock and Schluter, and was
originally made and published by <a
href="https://tinyurl.com/yvymcpsm">Harley, C. D. G. 2003. Ecology 84:
1477-1488</a>.</p>
<p>The question is: does the effect of herbivory on algal area depend on
height in the intertidal?</p>

<p>In the experiment, 32 plots were cleared of algae just below low
tide, these plots were therefore always underwater. Another 32 plots
were in the intertidal. A small amount of transplanted algae was glued
in the middle of each plot. 16 randomly chosen plots below low tide were
fenced, to exclude herbivores. The same was done for 16 plots in the
intertidal. The remaining plots were accessible to herbivores. The area
of algae remaining after a certain time was measured.</p>

<p>Another way to describe the design of the experiment is: a two-way
fully factorial experiment with treatments height (low or high) and
herbivory (minus or plus). There were 16 replicates per treatment
combination (i.e., 16 plots low height with herbivores, 16 plots low
height without herbivores, 16 plots high height with herbivores, and 16
plots high height without herbivores). Therefore, there were 64 plots in
total.</p>
<p>Now let’s think about degrees of freedom in this design. There are 64
observations.</p>

<p>Awesome, we know what to expect from the ANOVA table when we fit the
model.</p>
<p>If you’re a bit uncertain about this, sketch out the ANOVA table on a
piece of paper, and fill in the degrees of freedom you expect to see.
And ask a TA to check your sketch and thinking.</p>
</div>
<div
id="section-prepare-a-script-load-the-data-and-make-some-basic-checks-on-the-dataset."
class="section level3">
<h3>1. Prepare a script, load the data, and make some basic checks on
the dataset.</h3>
<p>You’ve done this before a few times now. Go for it! The dataset
<code>intertidalalgae.csv</code> is in the usual place.</p>
<p>The experimental design is known as “balanced” because there were
equal number of replicates (16) per treatment combination. This is
important to know, because in a balanced design, the statistical
analysis is simpler and more robust.</p>
<p>However, even when the <em>design</em> is balanced, the outcome data
may not be perfectly balanced (e.g., due to missing data). Therefore, it
is always important to check the data after loading it. Do a “group_by”
(with both explanatory variables) and “summarise” to check the number of
data points per treatment combination.</p>
<p>Also check that the two treatments do each indeed contain only two
levels. Here is how to do this with the <code>distinct</code>
function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>intertidal %&gt;%
  distinct(height)</code></pre>
<p>And we need to check for NAs. A quick method is to again do a
“group_by” and “summarise”, this time make it on a version of the
dataset with na.omit() applied. This function removes any rows with NAs
in any column.</p>
<p>Same result, so there are no NAs anywhere in the dataset. Note that
if we had found fewer rows in the na.omit() version, we would need to
investigate which rows and variables were missing data, and why.
Depending on the situation, we might need to exclude some treatment
combinations from the analysis if they had too few data points.</p>
<p>Have a look at the distribution of the response variable
<code>Area_cm2</code> in each of the four treatment combinations. Your
friend here is <code>facet_grid</code>.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="quiz-intertidal-low-values" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="quiz-intertidal-low-values-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

<div id="quiz-intertidal-low-values-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>What do you think is going on here? Why might algal area be so low
when herbivores are present at low tidal height? Discuss with your
neighbour or a TA. And why might there be more algae in the other
treatment combinations?</p>
<p>Whitlock and Schluter (in their book) transform the
<code>Area_cm2</code> variable by taking the square root. This might
make sense so it becomes a linear measure, rather than a being a square.
On the other hand, it doesn’t really make the distributions much
better!</p>
<p>But in any case, go ahead and square root transform it. Use the
square root for everything from now on. (Do make sure you do this,
otherwise you could get wrong some of the following questions.)</p>
</div>
<div id="section-visualise-the-answer-to-the-question"
class="section level3">
<h3>2. Visualise the answer to the question</h3>
<p>Now make a graph that will tell you the answer, about the effects of
herbivores and height, and in particular if the effect of herbivores
differs depending on height (i.e. is there an interaction?).</p>
<p>Use ggplot (of course) and map height to the x axis, and herbivores
to colour, and your transformed area variable to the y axis. The use
either <code>geom_boxplot</code> or <code>geom_point</code> (or both).
If you use <code>geom_point</code>, you might want to consider putting
this inside the brackets
<code>position=position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.2)</code></p>
<p><code>jitterdodge</code> sounds a bit funny eh! It does just what it
says, jitter the points a bit, so they don’t lie on top of each other,
and dodges the treatments out of each other’s way. Compare the graph to
if this wasn’t in the geom_point brackets.</p>
<p><img src="Unit7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Look at the graph, imagine a line connecting the means of the two
herbivore treatments at low height, and another line connecting the
means of the two herbivore treatments at mid height. Are these lines
parallel, or are they not parallel?</p>
<p>Look again. What is the effect of herbivores at low height? The
answer is that there is a large effect of herbivores at low height, with
much less algae when herbivores are present.</p>
<p>Now, what is the effect of herbivores at mid height? The answer is
that there no clear effect of herbivores at mid height, with similar
amounts of algae whether herbivores are present or not.</p>
<p>So we can pretty confidently say that the effect of herbivores
depends on tidal height. This is an interaction. Given the strength of
the pattern in the graph, we can be quite confident in our answer to the
question, even without making and interpreting a statistical model.</p>
<p>And in the ANOVA table, we expect that the interaction term will have
a large F value, and a small p value (less than 0.05).</p>
<hr />
<p>Just for some practice, and less so for answering any biological
question, calculate the mean and the standard deviation of each of the
treatment combinations. Hint: use <code>group_by</code>, include both
the explanatory variables, and then use <code>summarise</code>.</p>

<p>We can also see that, as expected, the ANOVA table contains rows for
both main effects and their interaction. And that each of these terms
has 1 degree of freedom, as we expected. Everything is good.</p>
<p>If we add up all the sums of squares, we get the total sum of
squares. Here it is about 18’500. We can check this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum((intertidal$Area_sqrt - mean(intertidal$Area_sqrt))^2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 18488.63</code></pre>
<p>(<em>Took me ages to get the brackets in the correct place

</div>
</div>
<p>We can see there is a statistically significant effect of herbivores,
but as we have an interaction, this must be interpreted with caution.
The effect of herbivores depends on tidal height. Looking at the graph,
there really is no effect of herbivores at mid intertidal range. So it
is pretty meaningless to say there is an overall effect of herbivores,
even when the model detects this.</p>
<p>With such a clear pattern in the graph, and in the ANOVA table, we
can be quite confident in saying that there is an interaction between
tidal height and herbivory. And we can see what causes this in the data:
a strong effect of herbivory at low tidal height, and no effect of
herbivory at mid tidal height.</p>
<p>In this situation, I (Owen) do not find it necessary to do post-hoc
tests to find out which treatments differ from which others. The graph
and the ANOVA table already tell us this quite clearly.</p>
<hr />
<p>If, however, we wanted to know if algal area was significantly
different between mid and low height in the absence of herbivores, then
we could do a post-hoc test for this specific comparison. But, be really
careful here… we have “mission creep” – we specified a clear and
important biological question at the start, and now we are moving on to
another question. Reasons to avoid this include: increasing the risk of
false positives, and the danger of “cherry picking” results that support
a desired conclusion.</p>
<p>Another really important reason to avoid this, or at least be very
careful, is that we can end up not finishing our projects because we
keep adding more and more questions! <strong>This is one of the most
important reasons for having a clear, well researched, and well
justified research question at the start of a project.</strong> Because
the end of the project is then already clearly defined at the beginning
of the project: <strong>the project ends when the question is
answered</strong>. (Of course there will be follow on questions, but
these go to the next project.)</p>

<h3>6. Make a visualisation of the data, good for publication</h3>
<p>Make a publication quality figure. Build it up step by step. Check
each new feature or adjustment works before making another. Work towards
a figure that meets the following criteria. The criteria are
intentionally “high-level”, so you will have to think about what they
mean in practice. This also gives you freedom to be creative in how you
meet the criteria.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is in a style that matches the intended publication (e.g., academic
journal, or popular science magazine). (You choose the publication
style.)</li>
<li>Clearly and directly addresses the research question.</li>
<li>Is interpretable on its own.</li>
<li>Shows the data honestly.</li>
<li>Make uncertainty visible.</li>
<li>Is visually clear and readable.</li>
<li>Is reproducible.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re done, or if you want feedback along the way, check in
with a TA, or with a neighbour. See what wonderful figures they
produced.</p>
<p>(Only if you really really have nothing better to do, here is a fun
challenge for you. Create a figure that would be suitable for inclusion
in a cyberpunk-style science magazine (think neon lights, high contrast,
futuristic vibes) while still being scientifically honest and
interpretable. If you do this, and are happy to share, please email your
figure to Owen so he can show it in a lecture! If you want to choose
another style, please go ahead, and please also share to Owen!)</p>

<h3>8. Critique and reflection</h3>
<p>Reflect on your analysis and reporting, and your learning. What went
well? What could be improved? Discuss with a neighbour or a TA.</p>
<p>What could be done better in the experiment? Discuss with a neighbour
or a TA.</p>
<p>One place where we could have improved the study is to have made a
hypothesis and prediction before doing the experiment. We may have
thought the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: in the mid intertidal the herbivores
are not active and perhaps even not present, due to the very variable
environmental conditions (e.g., exposure to air, temperature
fluctuations). Therefore, herbivory will have little effect on algal
area at mid tidal height. Whereas in the low intertidal, herbivores are
active and abundant, and will therefore strongly reduce algal area when
present.</li>
<li><strong>Prediction</strong>: we expect to find an interaction
between tidal height and herbivory, with a strong effect of herbivory at
low tidal height, and little or no effect of herbivory at mid tidal
height.</li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: in reality we <strong>MUST
NOT</strong> make up the hypothesis and prediction after seeing the
data! This is just an example of what could have been done before the
experiment was performed.)</p>

<div id="section-practical-part-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Practical part 2</h2>
<p>In this practical part, you will work through an analysis of
covariance. Please use this structure for your work on this
exercise:</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Get introduced to and think about the biological question.</li>
<li>Prepare a script, load the data, and make some basic checks on the
dataset.</li>
<li>Visualise to answer the question.</li>
<li>Fit an appropriate model. treatments.</li>
<li>Check the assumptions of the model.</li>
<li>Interpret the model.</li>
<li>Make a visualisation of the data, good for publication.</li>
<li>Write a short reporting sentence describing your findings.</li>
<li>Critique and reflection</li>
</ol>
<p><em>In this practical part, there is less guidance for you, and fewer
questions. This is intentional. As you experience more, you become more
capable to do what you already experienced, and more able and confident
to tackle new things. As you get the hang of these, we increase our
expectations of you! This is how learning works. Of course, reach out
for support at any point!</em></p>
<p>(The dataset in this exercise, and some text (itallic below) comes
from the excellent book <em>Statistical Rethinking</em> by Richard
McElreath.)</p>
<p>“<em>Africa is special. The second largest continent, it is the most
culturally and genetically diverse. Africa has about 3 billon fewer
people than Asia, but it has just as many living languages. Africa is so
genetically diverse that most of the genetic variation outside Africa is
just a subset of the variation within Africa. Africa is also
geographically special, in a puzzling way: Bad geography tends to be
related to bad economies outside of Africa, but African economies seem
immune to bad geography.</em>”</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will look at and analyse some data about the
last statement, that Africa is immune to bad geography, whereas the rest
of the world is not.</p>
<p>In the dataset <code>rugged.csv</code>, which you can find from the
usual place, each row is a country, and there are three variables of
interest to us:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rugged</code> – this is the Terrain Ruggedness Index, that
quantified the topographic heterogeneity of the landscape. E.g.,
Netherlands = low, Switzerland = high.</li>
<li><code>rgdppc_2000</code> – this is real gross domestic product per
capita in year 2000. In his book McElreath puts forward a good argument
for why one can already expect such a variable to be exponentially
distributed, such that we will need to log transform it. His argument is
based on growth being a multiplicative process.</li>
<li><code>cont_africa</code> – this is a binary variable (0s and 1s)
with 0 if a country is not in Africa and 1 if it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Get the dataset, do all the preliminaries in R, including reading in
the data.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look at the distribution of the <code>rgdppc_2000</code> variable
– and then create a log10 transformed version of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new variable (name it <code>cont_africa1</code>) in
which a row contains “Africa” if the country is in Africa, and “not
Africa” if it isn’t. We do this, as its easier and nicer to work with
this information in the variable, rather than just 0 and 1s. (In
general, in R, don’t use codes for things that can be represented by
words. Use the meaningful words. This is a good thing to do, because
then tables and graphs have those words, rather than cryptic codes, and
will be easier for you and others to interpret. Hint: use the function
ifelse inside mutate.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Good, now you’re all set to work through the following questions…</p>

<p>Now make a version of the dataset with no observations with NAs in

<p>Now make a log transformed version of the <code>rgdppc_2000</code>
variable. Use log base 10. And plot a graph that will tell you the
answer to the question… does the relationship between GDP and landscape
ruggedness differ between countries in Africa and those not in Africa.
Make a guess of if you think there is a statistically significant
difference.</p>
<p>Write one or two sentences about what you see in the graph. Is there
a difference between Africa and not Africa? If so, what is the
difference?</p>
<p>Fit an appropriate model to test if there is a statistically
significant difference in the relationship between GDP and ruggedness
between Africa and not Africa.</p>
<p>Check the assumptions of the model. Are they reasonably well met?</p>
<p>Interpret the model. Look at the ANOVA table. Check the degrees of
freedom for each term. Do they match what you expected?</p>
<p>What does the ANOVA table tell you about the relationship between GDP
and ruggedness in Africa versus not Africa? Is there a statistically
significant difference? Is Africa special in this respect?</p>
<p>Yes, we see that the interaction term is statistically significant,
indicating that the relationship between GDP and ruggedness differs
between African countries and those not in Africa.</p>
<p>Now make a beautiful figure suitable for publication, that shows the
relationship between GDP and ruggedness in Africa and not Africa. Make
sure it meets the criteria we discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is appropriate:</p>
<p><img src="Unit7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Note that to be absolutely sure that the plotted model is the same as
the one you fitted, you should use the <code>predict()</code> function
to get predicted values from your model, and then plot these predicted
values rather than using <code>geom_smooth()</code>.</p>
<p>Write a sentence or two about the pattern and the statistical
support.</p>
<p>Critique and reflect.</p>
