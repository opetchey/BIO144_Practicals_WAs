<h3>Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 7 of <em>Getting Started with R</em>, by Beckerman, Childs,
and Petchey.</li>
<li>Chapter 8 of First Edition <em>The New Statistics in R</em> by
Hector. This introduces the general concept of generalised linear models
quite nicely. There is a section on the Box-Cox transformation which you
might find interesting, but is not really an integral part of
generalised linear models. (In the Second Edition, this is Chapter
15.)</li>
<li>Section 9.4 of Chapter 9 of First Edition <em>The New Statistics in
R</em> by Hector. This offers a different perspective, and slightly more
complex one than in GSwR, on analysing count data with a poisson GLM.

<div id="section-the-biological-question" class="section level3">
<h3>0. The biological question</h3>
<p>Abalone (marine snails) are endangered in some parts of the world.
Knowing the age of an abalone is important for conservation efforts. The
age of an abalone can be estimated by counting the number of rings on
its shell, similar to counting tree rings. However, this requires
killing the abalone. A non-lethal method to estimate age is to use
measurements of the abalone’s physical characteristics, such as shell
length and shell diameter. We are interested in whether a suite of
explanatory variables are associated with abalone age. And how much
variation in age can be explained by these variables.</p>
<p><em>This is a real dataset originally collected in Tasmania for
fisheries research, made widely available via the UCI Machine Learning
Repository. Although some variables are labelled as millimetres in the
dataset documentation, the numerical values are clearly rescaled. We
therefore treat these measurements as being on an arbitrary but
consistent length scale, and avoid interpreting coefficients in literal
physical units.</em></p>
<p>The dataset has in each row an individual abalone, and has the
following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Rings</code>: Number of rings on the abalone shell (used to
estimate age)</li>
<li><code>Sex</code>: Sex, with three categories: ‘M’ (male), ‘F’
(female), and ‘I’ (infant, i.e., not yet sexually mature)</li>
<li><code>Length_mm</code>: Length of the abalone shell (in mm)</li>
<li><code>Diameter_mm</code>: Diameter of the abalone shell (in mm)</li>
<li><code>Height_mm</code>: Height of the abalone shell (in mm)</li>
<li><code>Whole_weight_g</code>: Whole weight of the abalone (in
grams)</li>
<li><code>Shuck_weight_g</code>: Weight of the abalone meat (in
grams)</li>
<li><code>Viscera_weight_g</code>: Weight of the abalone viscera (in
grams)</li>
<li><code>Shell_weight_g</code>: Weight of the abalone shell (in
grams)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we should not use variables that can only be measured after
killing the abalone (e.g., weights) to predict age, as we want a
non-lethal method. Therefore, we will only use <code>Diameter_mm</code>,
<code>Length_mm</code>, <code>Height_mm</code>, and
<code>Whole_weight_g</code> as explanatory variables.</p>
<p>The response variable is <code>Rings</code>, which is a count of the
number of rings on the shell. Therefore we know already that we should
not use a linear model to analyse this data, but rather a generalised
linear model with a Poisson error distribution would be a good starting
point.</p>

<p>Recall that back in multiple regression we learned about collinearity
and that we could measure the potential importance with a variance
inflation factor. VIFs are still useful in Poisson GLMs because they
tell us whether predictors are strongly correlated with each other. High
VIFs warn us that coefficient estimates may be unstable and hard to
interpret, even if the model fits well.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can see from the pairwise scatterplots that all four
explanatory variables appear to be associated with Rings. Therefore, we
will need to be very careful when interpreting the results of a multiple
regression or GLM with all four explanatory variables included.</p>
<p>Anyway, it looks like the answer to the biological question is likely
to be ‘yes’: there are associations between abalone age (Rings) and the
explanatory variables. But just how strong are these associations, and
which variables are most important? And how useful for predicting age?
Let’s find out by fitting a Poisson GLM and inspecting it in detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-fit-an-appropriate-model." class="section level3">
<h3>3. Fit an appropriate model.</h3>
<p>We will fit a Poisson GLM with Rings as the response variable and all
four explanatory variables included. Make this model. Do not include any
interaction terms.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-check-the-assumptions-of-the-model."
class="section level3">
<h3>4. Check the assumptions of the model.</h3>
<p>Make the four standard diagnostic plots for the Poisson GLM you have
fitted.</p>

<p>So, we have a problem: the QQ-plot shows that the largest residuals
are much larger than expected under the Poisson model. This suggests
that the data may be overdispersed relative to the Poisson distribution,
or that the model is not capturing all relevant structure in the
data.</p>

<p>This is very interesting, since based on the qq plot we expected
overdispersion, but the calculated ratio is less than 1, suggesting
underdispersion. This discrepancy can occur because the qq plot is
sensitive to extreme residuals, while the deviance ratio summarizes
overall fit. It suggest that for some parts of the residual
distribution, the model fits poorly (extreme residuals), while for other
parts the model fits better than would be expected! Complicated. And
this would need modelling of greater sophistication to resolve properly.
Let us continue with the current model and see how well it performs.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-interpret-the-model." class="section level3">
<h3>5. Interpret the model.</h3>
<p>Recall that we need to be very careful when interpreting the
coefficients of this model, because the explanatory variables are
strongly correlated with each other (collinearity).</p>

<p>Now make a model without the <code>Height_mm</code> and
<code>Diameter_mm</code> variables, since these were the only
significant predictors in the full model. Fit this reduced model and
inspect the summary.</p>

<p>You should see that <code>Length_mm</code> is now significant, while
<code>Whole_weight_g</code> remains non-significant. This illustrates
how collinearity can affect the significance of predictors in a multiple
regression or GLM.</p>
<p>What about if we make a model with only <code>Whole_weight_g</code>
as the explanatory variable? Do this and inspect the summary.</p>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## glm(formula = Rings ~ Whole_weight_g, family = poisson, data = abalone_data)
## 
## Coefficients:

## 
## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4</code></pre>
<p>Wow! Now <code>Whole_weight_g</code> is highly significant. This
again shows how collinearity can affect the interpretation of
predictors. When considered alone, <code>Whole_weight_g</code> appears
strongly associated with Rings, but when considered alongside the other
correlated predictors, its significance disappears.</p>
<p>This is a classic example of the challenges posed by collinearity in
multiple regression and GLMs. It highlights the importance of careful
model interpretation and consideration of predictor correlations.</p>
<p>In summary, we have found some associations, but the strong
collinearity among predictors makes it difficult to draw clear
conclusions about the individual associations of each variable on
abalone age (Rings).</p>
<p><strong>How good is the model?</strong></p>
<p>To assess the overall fit of the model, we can look at measures such
as the deviance, AIC, and pseudo-R² values. However, interpreting these
in the context of a Poisson GLM with collinear predictors can be
challenging.</p>
<p>Another method is to plot the predicted values against the observed
values to visually assess the fit. Make this graph and the use linear
regression to add a line of best fit. What do you expect the intercept
and slope to be if the model is good? And what do you expect the
r-squared to be if the model is good?</p>

<div id="section-make-a-visualisation-of-the-data-good-for-publication."
class="section level3">
<h3>6. Make a visualisation of the data, good for publication.</h3>
<p>Since the aim is to predict abalone age (Rings) from the explanatory
variables, a useful plot would be to show the relationship between the
predicted Rings from the model and the observed Rings. We have already
made this plot above. You could enhance it further by adding confidence
intervals or prediction intervals around the regression line, and by
improving the aesthetics for publication quality.</p>
<p>If we wanted to visualise the effect of individual explanatory
variables, we could create conditions plots to visualise the effects of
each predictor while holding others constant.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_data &lt;- expand.grid(
  Length_mm = seq(min(abalone_data$Length_mm), max(abalone_data$Length_mm), length.out = 100),
  Diameter_mm = mean(abalone_data$Diameter_mm),
  Height_mm = mean(abalone_data$Height_mm),
  Whole_weight_g = mean(abalone_data$Whole_weight_g)
)
predictions &lt;- predict(ab_glm, newdata = new_data, type = &quot;response&quot;)
new_data &lt;- new_data |&gt; 
  mutate(Predicted_Rings = predictions)
ggplot(new_data, aes(x = Length_mm, y = Predicted_Rings)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = &quot;Predicted Rings vs Length_mm\n(Full Model)&quot;,
       x = &quot;Length (mm)&quot;,
       y = &quot;Rings&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>And we instantly see the unlikely result that as Length increases,
predicted Rings decreases. This is a consequence of the collinearity
among predictors, and shows how difficult it is to interpret individual
predictor effects in the presence of strong collinearity.</p>
<p>Let’s make the same graph for the model with only
<code>Length_mm</code> and <code>Diameter_g</code> as predictors:</p>
<p><img src="Unit8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>And now we have a more sensible result: as Length increases,
predicted Rings also increases.</p>
<p>This shows just how dangerous collinearity can be for interpreting
the effects of individual predictors in multiple regression and
GLMs.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-write-reporting-sentences." class="section level3">
<h3>7. Write reporting sentences.</h3>
<p>We could write something like this:</p>
<p><em>Based on the Poisson GLM analysis of the abalone dataset, we
found that both Diameter_mm and Height_mm were significantly associated
with the number of Rings, indicating that larger abalones tend to be
older. However, due to strong collinearity among the explanatory
variables, interpreting the individual effects of Length_mm and
Whole_weight_g was challenging. The model’s predictions aligned well
with observed values, suggesting reasonable overall fit, but caution is
warranted when interpreting individual predictor effects due to
collinearity issues. In summary, we found that easily measurable
physical characteristics of abalones can provide useful information
about their age, but further investigation is needed to disentangle the
effects of correlated predictors.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="section-critique-and-reflection" class="section level3">
<h3>8. Critique and reflection</h3>
<p>We have strayed very much into a situation where we learned more
about the challenges of collinearity in multiple regression and than we
did about analysing count data. And much of what we learned about
collinearity was already known and applies equally to linear and other
models.</p>

<p>Let us again consider the abalone dataset, but simplify by only using
one explanatory variable, <code>Length_mm</code>, to predict the
response variable <code>Rings</code>. Then we can focus on something

<p>In a Poisson GLM we use a log link, which means the model does not
add a fixed number of rings for each increase in length. Instead, the
coefficient tells us how the expected number of rings is multiplied. A
slope of 1.53 means that increasing length by 1 mm multiplies the
expected number of rings by (1.53) , not that it adds 1.53 rings. So if
an abalone has 10 rings at 0.5 mm, increasing its length to 1.5 mm (an
increase of 1 mm) gives an expected number of about 10 = 46 rings, not
15.3.</p>
