<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On this web page you will find the homework, practical exercises and
weekly quiz for Unit 1 of BIO144.</p>
<p>All other information for the course is on the OLAT course webpages,
and web pages linked to from there: <a
href="https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/17827987490/CourseNode/112943793799740">OLAT

<div id="section-homework" class="section level2">
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>In every week there will be the following homework. In some weeks
there may be additional homework. All homework is for your own practice
and learning. It will not be marked or graded.</p>
<p><strong>Homework common to all weeks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review the material from the lecture(s) this week. Make sure you
understand the concepts and ideas presented. Ensure you can follow any
mathematical or statistical explanations. Ensure you can do the R that
is needed for the week’s learning objectives.</li>
<li>When you find things you don’t understand or have trouble doing
(e.g., in R), make a note of these. You can then ask a teaching
assistant (TA) for help during the practical session, and you can ask on
the Discussion Forum on OLAT. You can also ask questions during the
lectures.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no other homework for this week.</p>

<h2>Practical</h2>
<div id="section-exercise-1-of-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 1 (of 1)</h3>
<p>During the first lecture you collected data on class reaction times.
The exercise this unit is for you to use R to analyse the dataset.</p>
<p>To help, we give you a nearly complete and working script of R code.
The script does, however, contain some deliberate errors! You’ll need to
find and correct these! This is a common feature of code we write – we
usually make a mistake of some kind, get and error message, and need to
troubleshoot and correct. So this exercise is good practice for what
you’ll experience during the course!</p>
<p>The script also contains some “???” that you need to replace with
appropriate text. The errors get a bit harder as you go through the
script. Good luck!</p>
<p>Click on the links below, and hopefully the files will download. If
they appears in your browser do <code>Save As...</code> and save them to
somewhere safe on your computer. Do not add a file extension. Do not let
a file extension be added (e.g., the Chrome browser automatically
attempts to add a <code>.txt</code> file extension… you have to delete
it!). Leave the file extension as they are (only <code>.r</code> or
<code>.csv</code>) . Do not open the data file in Excel or any other
program.</p>
<p>Script file: <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opetchey/BIO144_Practicals_WAs/refs/heads/main/assets/scripts/reaction_time_analysis_needs_fixing.r">reaction_time_analysis.r</a></p>
<p>Data file: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ye255bdm" target="_blank">
Link to Reaction Time Dataset </a></p>
<p>Get organised by setting up a project folder on your computer and
downloading the above files into it. This will be important so you can
know where your copy of the data files is located. You must know this to
be able to read the data into R.</p>
<p>Then open the script in RStudio and get it working, not forgetting to
think about the questions in the script, about assumptions, effect size,
biological significance, statistical significance, and so on.</p>
<p>Write a sentence about the finding. Cover statistical and practical
significance. Be critical. Ask a teaching assistant (TA) for feedback,
see if they can make suggests of how you could improve what you’ve
done.</p>
<p>The statistical test used in the script is a t-test. Hopefully you
have experienced this in previous studies. Please ensure you have
reviewed that material if you are not familiar with it anymore. If you
are new to t-tests, please ask a TA for help.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to help you think about your experience
correcting the script and analysing the data.</p>

<p>If you finish early and are happy with everything so far, and you
want a challenge, figure out how to use RMarkdown to create a word
document, html file, or pdf of your findings.</p>
<p>Here is a working version of the script. Please don’t look at it
until you have finished your own corrections! <a

<div id="section-weekly-quiz" class="section level2">
<h2>Weekly Quiz</h2>
<p>In the final exam you will experience questions that ask for a
numeric answer. Then you will need to give the answer with the specified
precision. For example, if the question asks for pi rounded to 2 digits,
you should answer 3.14. If you answer 3.1 or 3.142 you could be marked
wrong. Here is what that might look like in a question. Try giving a
wrong answer to see what happens!</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="quiz2" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="quiz2-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

<div id="quiz2-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the final exam you will sometimes get multiple choice questions
where more than one answer is correct. Here is an example question. Try
it out!</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="quiz3" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="quiz3-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="quiz3-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

<p>(Obviously pizza toppings are not part of the BIO144 course content.
This question is just to illustrate the question type.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Please note that if you selected only two of the correct
toppings you get the message “Incorrect. Be sure to select every correct
answer.” This is because all four correct toppings need to be selected
to get the question right. It does not necessarily mean that the options
you selected are wrong (though they might be). It means that you might
have missed some correct options, and or you might have selected some
incorrect options.</em></strong></p>
<p>In the final exam there may be more complex types of questions. Here
is an example of one such question type. Try it out!</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="weekly-quiz-1" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="weekly-quiz-1-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

<p>And now for some more questions about this weeks content. These, like
the questions in all the following Weekly Quizzes are just for you to
practice with. They do not count towards your final grade. They should
help you know if you’re following and understanding the material.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="weekly-quiz-2" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="weekly-quiz-2-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="weekly-quiz-2-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="weekly-quiz-2-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some questions in the weekly quizzes, and during the course might
appear a bit subjective. They are designed to make you think about the
material, and to reflect on your own experience. There are no right or
wrong answers to these questions. (There are no questions like this in
the final exam, of course!) Here is an example:</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="weekly-quiz-3" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="weekly-quiz-3-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="weekly-quiz-3-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="weekly-quiz-3-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sometimes a weekly quiz question might even need you to look up
something new, or something from a previous course. This is to encourage
you to develop good habits of looking things up, and learning
independently. Here might be an example:</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="weekly-quiz-5" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="weekly-quiz-5-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="weekly-quiz-5-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="weekly-quiz-5-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another example:</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="weekly-quiz-6" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="weekly-quiz-6-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="weekly-quiz-6-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="weekly-quiz-6-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Final question for this week:</p>
