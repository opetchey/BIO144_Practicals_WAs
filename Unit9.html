<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On this web page you will find the homework, practical exercises and
weekly quiz for Unit 9 of BIO144.</p>
<p>All other information for the course is on the OLAT course webpages,
and web pages linked to from there: <a

<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>All homework is for your own practice and learning. It will not be
marked or graded.</p>
<div id="section-homework-common-to-all-weeks" class="section level3">
<h3>Homework common to all weeks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Review the material from the lecture(s) this week. Make sure you
understand the concepts and ideas presented. Ensure you can follow any
mathematical or statistical explanations. Ensure you can do the R that
is needed for the week’s learning objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>When you find things you don’t understand or have trouble doing
(e.g., in R), make a note of these. You can then ask a teaching
assistant (TA) for help during the practical session, and you can ask on
the Discussion Forum on OLAT. You can also ask questions during the
lectures.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-video-walkthrough-insect-death" class="section level3">
<h3>Video walkthrough; insect death!</h3>
<p>Please remember that you’ll get much more out the videos if you work
through the example in R, either during or after watching.</p>
<p>Please note that these videos were made some time ago, so for example
the method used to import the data is a little different to what we use
now. However, the statistical concepts and R code for analysis are still
relevant.</p>
<p>The first video introduces the biological question and the data. It
also fits a linear model and checks the assumptions of the model,
showing how badly things can go wrong if you don’t check the
assumptions!</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PXCgb1zGK8s?si=KzfZIbPGXR0j6_32" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>The second video explains and fits a much more appropriate model for
the data: a generalized linear model with a binomial error distribution
and a logit link function. We see that the conclusion is very different
to that from the linear model!</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JPsFGxdenQ?si=ZNcnymehjx65F_Gm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>The third video shows how to check for overdispersion in a binomial
model, and how to make a nice visualisation of the results.</p>

<h2>Practical part 1</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you will work through a binary (yes/no) type of
data analysis. There is much less guidance than in previous exercises,
so you will need to think about the steps to take yourself. Of course,
you can always ask for help from a teaching assistant (TA) during the
practical session. If you find the exercise rather overwhelming, try to
focus on just one step at a time. Do not look at the whole exercise at
once, but rather break it down into manageable pieces.</p>
<p>The steps to follow are, as usual:</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Get introduced to and think about the biological question.</li>
<li>Prepare a script, load the data, and make some basic checks on the
dataset.</li>
<li>Visualise to answer the question.</li>
<li>Fit an appropriate model.</li>
<li>Check the assumptions of the model.</li>
<li>Interpret the model.</li>
<li>Make a visualisation of the data, good for publication.</li>
<li>Write a sentence describing your findings.</li>
<li>Critique and reflection</li>
</ol>
<div id="section-biological-question" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Biological question</h3>
<p>A common use of binomial models is to explain species habitat
requirements. One looks to see which of a set of environmental variables
explains the presence / absence of a species in a particular
location.</p>
<p>Your challenge is to provide explanations of the presence / absence
of the White Tailed Ptarmigan, a coastal alpine bird. I.e., we wish to
test hypotheses about explanations.</p>
<p><strong>Something new and cool</strong> For this exercise, you will
work with a real dataset that you wil get from an online data
repository! The name of the data file is
<strong><code>presabs_both_IndYears_allvars_final.csv</code></strong>.
This datafile and a few others are available at <a
href="https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.c2378">this web
page on the Dryad data repository</a></p>
<p>The same web page contains a <code>README.txt</code> file that
explains the meaning of each of the variables in the dataset. This is
very important, otherwise you will not be able to interpret your
results!</p>
<p>Remember to go through all the workflow steps.</p>
<p>Here are some specific tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a list of the environmental factors in the dataset.</li>
<li>Look on Wikipedia or elsewhere for natural history information about
the White Tailed Ptarmigan, and based on this make hypotheses about
which of the environmental variables in the dataset will be related to
presence / absence, and the direction (positive or negative) of the
relationship. (Do not look at the data in this step!)</li>
<li>Make graphs of how presence absence varies with individual
environmental factors (this would be in the initial exploration of the
data, before any modelling). This should give a clue about if your
hypotheses are supported by the data.</li>
<li>Develop an understanding of correlations among environmental
factors. Make sure you are clear about why this is important,
particularly in terms of shared explanatory power.</li>
<li>Test your hypotheses about explanations of the presence / absence,
using a binomial GLM.</li>
<li>Show some of the modelled relationships between presence/absence and
environmental variables, e.g. by using model predictions to show the
estimated effect of one environmental variable while all others are held
constant.</li>
<li>Write a sentence or two about the results that would clearly
communicate your findings to other biologists.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest you put all this together into a little report that you can
be proud of :) Show it to a teaching assistant to see what you did well,
and to be encouraged about what you can do even better.</p>

<div id="section-practical-part-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Practical part 2</h2>
<p>The biological challenge here is to predict death based on
information derived from echocardiograms. Note that when the aim is to
predict, we are not so much interested in understanding the underlying
biological processes, but rather in getting the best possible
predictions. We don’t look at prediction so much in BIO144, so here is a
chance for you to experience it, just a little.</p>
<p>As with the previous exercise, you need to get the data from an
online repository. This time it is the <a
href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/38/echocardiogram">UCI Machine
Learning Repository</a>. The web page contains the data, and the
metadata, that is, a description of variables in the data, and other
features.</p>
<p>The dataset does not have a <em>header row</em> with the names of the
variables. (The <em>header row</em> of a dataset is not part of the data
itself; it just gives names to the columns of the data.) You can get
these from the names file. Best is to in R add the header row after
importing the data.</p>
<p>Note that the response variable to use is <code>alive_at_1</code>,
and not <code>survival</code> or <code>still_alive</code>.</p>
<p>There are lots of “?” in the dataset. You will need to do something
about that; best to replace them with NA during the import process with
read_csv.</p>
<p>Remember to go through all the workflow steps.</p>
<p>Here are some specific tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a list of the echocardiogram features in the dataset.</li>
<li>Look on Wikipedia or elsewhere for information about echocardiograms
and hearts, and based on this make hypotheses about which of the
features in the dataset will be related to death within one year, and
the direction (positive or negative) of the relationship.</li>
<li>Make graphs of how death varies with individual echocardiogram
features (this would be in the initial exploration of the data, before
any modelling). This should give a clue about if your hypotheses are
supported by the data.</li>
<li>Develop and understanding of correlations among echocardiogram
features.</li>
<li>Develop an appropriate model of death within 1 year, using whatever
methods you see fit to find useful explanatory variables.</li>
<li>Show some of the model predictions, e.g. by using model predictions
to show the estimated effect of one echocardiogram feature while all
others are held constant.</li>
<li>Write a sentence or two about the results that would clearly
communicate your findings to other biologists.</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-final-thoughts-on-prediction" class="section level3">
<h3>Final thoughts on prediction</h3>
<p>Prediction is a very big topic in statistics and machine learning.
One reason is that prediction is very widely used in many fields,
including medicine, finance, marketing, ecology, image recognition, and
many others. This means that there is a lot of money to be made by
developing better prediction methods! And there is also a lot of social
good to be done by using prediction to improve healthcare, environmental
management, and so on.</p>
<p>Another reason is that prediction can be very challenging, especially
when the data is complex or high-dimensional. This makes it an
interesting and active area of research.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that when the aim is prediction, it is
very important to assess how good the predictions are on new data that
was not used to fit the model. This is often done by splitting the data
into a training set and a test set. The model is fitted to the training
set, and then predictions are made for the test set, which are then
compared to the actual observed values in the test set.</p>
<p>The reason for doing this is that we could make a very complex model
that fits the training data very well, but does not generalise well to
new data. This is called overfitting. By assessing the predictions on a
test set, we can get a better idea of how well the model will perform on
new data. One way of doing this is termed <em>cross-validation</em>,
where the data is split into several parts, and the model is fitted to
some parts and tested on the remaining parts, in a rotating fashion.</p>
<p>There are many methods that can be used for prediction, and many ways
to assess how good the predictions are. If you are interested in
learning more about prediction, there are many online resources, and
also university courses on this topic.</p>
