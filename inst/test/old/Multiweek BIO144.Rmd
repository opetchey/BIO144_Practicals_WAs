## Week 1{.tabset}

### Introduction

Welcome to Week 1 of BIO144! Week 1 is a bit different from other weeks because its focuses on introducing how the course is going to work, collecting some data for us to use, and reviewing some material that it would be good for you to remember from previous courses (or learn here if you don't know it yet!)

In subsequent weeks we will focus more on the data analysis concepts and practice.

However, just like all weeks, there is:

* A chapter of the course book.
* A "lecture" on Monday.
* Some homework to ideally do between Monday and the practical on Thursday or Friday.
* A practical session on Thursday or Friday.
* A weekly quiz to check your understanding.

### Lecture




### Homework




### Practical part 1

#### Exercise

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```



### Practical part 2

#### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```


*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaluated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```



### Weekly Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz1}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base", message = "Not quite right, try again."),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE, , message = "Yes, that's correct!"),
    answer("codetools"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```


```{r quiz2}
question_numeric(
  "What is pi rounded to 2 digits?",
  answer(3, message = "Don't forget to use the digits argument"),
  answer(3.1, message = "Too few digits"),
  answer(3.142, message = "Too many digits"),
  answer(3.14, correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  min = 3,
  max = 4,
  step = 0.01
)
```


```{r quiz3}
question_checkbox(
  "Select all the toppings that belong on a Margherita Pizza:",
  answer("tomato", correct = TRUE),
  answer("mozzarella", correct = TRUE),
  answer("basil", correct = TRUE),
  answer("extra virgin olive oil", correct = TRUE),
  answer("pepperoni", message = "Great topping! ... just not on a Margherita Pizza"),
  answer("onions"),
  answer("bacon"),
  answer("spinach"),
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  try_again = "Be sure to select all four toppings!"
)
```
