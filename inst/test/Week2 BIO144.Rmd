## Introduction

Welcome to Week 2 of BIO144! 

## Course book

This week we will be covering Chapter 2 of [the course book](https://opetchey.github.io/BIO144_Course_Book/).

## Lecture




## Homework




## Practical part 1

### Exercise

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```



## Practical part 2

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```


*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaluated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```



## Weekly Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz1}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base", message = "Not quite right, try again."),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE, , message = "Yes, that's correct!"),
    answer("codetools"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```


```{r quiz2}
question_numeric(
  "What is pi rounded to 2 digits?",
  answer(3, message = "Don't forget to use the digits argument"),
  answer(3.1, message = "Too few digits"),
  answer(3.142, message = "Too many digits"),
  answer(3.14, correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  min = 3,
  max = 4,
  step = 0.01
)
```


```{r quiz3}
question_checkbox(
  "Select all the toppings that belong on a Margherita Pizza:",
  answer("tomato", correct = TRUE),
  answer("mozzarella", correct = TRUE),
  answer("basil", correct = TRUE),
  answer("extra virgin olive oil", correct = TRUE),
  answer("pepperoni", message = "Great topping! ... just not on a Margherita Pizza"),
  answer("onions"),
  answer("bacon"),
  answer("spinach"),
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  try_again = "Be sure to select all four toppings!"
)
```
